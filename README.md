# barc4sr
**BARC** library for **S**ynchrotron **R**adiation

This library was created for facilitating the use of [SRW](https://github.com/ochubar/SRW) 
and [WOFRY](https://github.com/oasys-kit/wofry) for a few routine calculations

## installation

bar4sr is on PyPi! So it can be installed as ```pip install barc4sr``` _hooray_!!! Otherwise, clone the project, fix the (many bugs) and help improve it...

## TODO:

Ideally, I want to add the same functionalities to bending-magnets and wigglers through SRW.
I am also considering interfacing [SPECTRA](https://spectrax.org/spectra/index.html), but only if there is the need for that.

## Examples:
Check the examples! You can learn a lot from them.
